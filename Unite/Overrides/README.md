Note: This contains peices of code that are meant to be replace
functions in existing classes or added directly to it.

These are NOT drag and drop files. They contain part of the code
that need to be copy and paste base on the top comment directions.

Also each file are named base on the feature of change they do. The directory
they are in is the file name. 

In short, this is mostly a log of changes and is NOT meant to be used as an 
easy solution to add features or patches.
