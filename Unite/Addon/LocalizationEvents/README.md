This addon is meant to pull data from csvs stored in Assets\Localization (or at least for now, I may make the path configurable later). 
The main goal is to hold dialog text in a csv that can be edited and viewd in a spreadsheet while also providing events to use these
for text fields. I may also add text formating options and better autowarp if I have time. 

This csv need to be formated correctly. 
-The first cell/word need to be locale_key. 
-The first row/line need to be language keys (liek en, es, fr, de).
-The first column needs to be keys for the dialog/terms.
-formating should be how most spreadsheets exports to a csv.
